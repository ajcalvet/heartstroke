# Predicting Risk of Heart Stroke with Machine Learning

This repository archives my report for a Data Science project in which patients' medical data is analyzed and different machine learning algorithms are leveraged and trained on the cleaned data in order to predict future risk of heart stroke in new patients.


This report goes over my methodology, findings, and model performance. The full Python code for the project (as a Jupyter notebook) is documented in the last pages of the report.
